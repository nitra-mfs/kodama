1. STORYTELLING

Kodama is a game in which you play a little hero from an ancient forest.
This forest was once flourishing and every being and non-beings were living
in a perfect harnomy, like rarely seen.
One day, from a far off land came a plague, something so vile it ruined
the whole equilibrium in a matter of hours and devastated the forest until
its last bit of vitality. This evil thing has covered everything. Eternal night
has set, forever. Most of those who have been trapped became as evil as
this sickness. They were you friends, you siblings, now they want you with them.
You're the last one the plague have not reach. And you have a way to get rid
of it. You have to get trough the entire forest until you get to the kodama's
shelter to find the right answer and incantations.
You, alone have to find your own path toward the dark forest and avoid being
captured or killed.
Your light is the only way to alight the darkness!

2. MAP FILES

This section describe how the files containig maps are writen.

    2.1 EXTENSION AND REQUIREMENTS
        The files describing a map for this game have the extention .kmf.
        If you want to write your own map, you need to respect some rules
        listed as follow.
        List of differents charcaters allowed:
            ->' ' = free space
            ->'#' = block
            ->'X' = deadly block
            ->'O' = fragile block
            ->'B' = bomb
            ->'+' = enemies
            ->'*' = starting point
            ->'@' = ending point
        Only one starting point and one ending point is allowed.
        The map must be rectangle.
        All the blocks which form the border must be a #.
        The last line must contain an int between 1 and 9 used as id.

    2.2 CHECKER
        As seen previosly, it's possible to write our own map. To be sure that
        our maps have the correct requirements, a checker has been implemented.
        To check your map, use the rule "checker" of the Makefile. This rule  
        will produce the checker binary. You can run it in two ways:
            -> ./checker <path to your map>
            -> ./checker all
        The rule all will check all the maps containing in the default folder (
        ./maps/).

   2.3 ADD MAP
        To add your map, add the path in maps/path.txt. The id that you put in
        your map will define the coresponding level.

4. TIPS & GAMEPLAY

    4.1 Guide yourself into the dark -
            You won't see anything but you, your enemies and the escape
            yellow block (which is your goal).
            Too see your environment you can either learn and experiment
            with the map and memorize your surrounding or you can trigger
            many little light particles to bounce on the walls thus allowing
            you to have a quick view of the map
    4.2 Hold the spacebar! -
            Holding the spacebar allow you to charge more particles to be
            scattered
    4.3 Be careful though -
            If your light particles touch your enemies they will see you
            and come a bit closer to you. If they are close enough they
            will pursue you.
    4.4 Run! -
            Your enemies are slow, if you run fast enough, far away enough
            from them, the won't be able to see you anymore.
    4.5 You can have bombs -
            Bombs are you best friend!
            They are scattered in the maps for you to collect them.
            They have multiple use:
            4.5.1 Freeze you enemy
            4.5.2 Destroy the fragile block
    4.6 Fragile blocks -
            Have you ever been kind of stuck by something invisible?
            Your light go throught it but you cannot. It is not a bug,
            it is a feature! Indeed, thoose are fragile blocks.
            Throw a bomb at them to open shortcuts. Some maps may even
            require you to break some blocks open!
    4.7 Find the exit -
            It may be hard to know where you are. Some elements can act
            as a reference point for you to move. The big yellow block
            is your goal, GO FOR IT!
    4.8 Do it quick -
            Did you noticed that little counter? Do you know what happens
            when it gets to zero? Hum? Yeah. You die.
    4.9 Try again as much as you want -
            The more you play a map, the better you know it and the faster
            you will.
    4.10 Create your own map -
            Express you imagination!
